## Subscription Guide

Subscriptions to the Pacifica notifications service require a notifications URL and may contain some authentication.
Discuss with the Systems Administrator of your Pacifica installation about authenticating to the notifications service.

The service description is located
[here](https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-notifications/blob/master/docs/exampleusage.md#subscriptions)
and we will dig further into specifics for this dispatcher.

```bash
JSONPATH=$(cat pacifica/dispatcher_proxymod/jsonpath2/proxymod.txt)
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u user:password http://notify.example.com/eventmatch -d'{
    "name": "ProxyMod Event Match",
    "jsonpath": "'${JSONPATH}'",
    "target_url": "http://mylaptop.example.com:8069/receive"
}'
```

## Upload Guide

To start the process an initial upload needs to be executed. The data and uploader configuration is located in
the `tests` directory.

 1. Install the Pacifica CLI.
```bash
env/bin/pip3 install pacifica-cli
```
 2. Change working directory to `tests`.
```bash
cd tests/test_files/C234-1234-1234/data
```
 3. Configure the CLI (you will need input from your Systems Administrator for the values here).
```bash
pacifica-cli configure
```
 4. Perform the upload and add the additional project information.
```bash
pacifica-cli upload --project XXXX
